# Welcome to the SUBFROST Documentation

SUBFROST is a novel trust-minimized Bitcoin sidechain that leverages the **FROST** (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold) signature scheme to secure its two-way peg. It introduces a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, where validators stake the native `FROST` token to secure the network and earn rewards.

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to understanding, using, and developing on the SUBFROST platform.

## Core Concepts

    to="/docs/developer-guide/frost-protocol">
    SUBFROST's two-way peg is secured by a large, dynamic set of validators using FROST threshold signatures, eliminating single points of failure.

  <Card
    title="Proof-of-Stake"
    icon="💸"
    to="/docs/developer-guide/proof-of-stake">
    The network is secured by validators who stake `FROST` tokens, participating in consensus and earning rewards from transaction fees and the emission schedule.
