# SUBFROST
SUBFROST is a decentralized custodian that enables a trustless DeFi ecosystem on Bitcoin L1. 
It operates as a **Layer-0** (need to link), designed to issue BTC synthetic assets directly onto Bitcoin via metaprotocol execution layers like Alkanes, BRC-20 2.0 and OP_NET.


## The purpose of SUBFROST
Although the Bitcoin DeFi landscape is one of the most promising spaces in cryptocurrency, complex applications in these ecosystems, like AMMs, borrow/lends and zK mixers, **are not interoperable with native BTC**.

SUBFROST exists to offer two BTC synthetics, both of which are foundational to a competitive DeFi ecosystem, and both of which already carry a heavy demand:
1. **frBTC**: the first and only synthetic asset on Bitcoin, pegged 1:1 to BTC, and secured by Bitcoin Consensus & **FROST**, enabling nables users to leverage their BTC across any application currently imaginable, without ever leaving the Bitcoin blockchain.
2. **dxBTC**: the yield-bearing variant of BTC, enabling users to maintain full exposure to BTC while earning a yield in the simplest and most secure way possible.

Sound boring? Well, without a BTC synthetic like frBTC, there will be a lack of interest in Bitcoin DeFi, and a continued reliance on trust-dependent, cross-chain options like wrapped BTC on Ethereum.
