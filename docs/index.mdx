# Welcome to the SUBFROST Documentation

SUBFROST is a decentralized custodian that enables a trustless DeFi ecosystem on Bitcoin. It operates as a Layer 0 system, building fraud proofs as ZK circuits to ensure the integrity of its operations.

At its core, SUBFROST uses the **FROST** (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold) signature scheme, allowing signing groups of up to 255 participants to collectively sign transactions. This decentralized approach to custody is managed by a peer-to-peer network built on QUIC and libp2p, ensuring robust and secure communication.

SUBFROST is designed to issue synthetic assets, such as a synthetic BTC, directly onto Bitcoin's metaprotocol execution layer, including support for Alkanes and BRC-20 tokens. It achieves this without relying on `OP_CAT`, although assets managed by SUBFROST can be bridged to other systems that do use it.

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to understanding, using, and developing on the SUBFROST platform.
