# What is SUBFROST?
SUBFROST is a decentralized custodian that enables a trustless DeFi ecosystem on Bitcoin L1. 
It operates as a [**Layer-0**](./technical-overview), designed to issue BTC synthetic assets directly onto Bitcoin via metaprotocol execution layers like Alkanes, BRC-20 2.0 and OP_NET.

## The purpose of SUBFROST
Although Bitcoin DeFi is one of the most promising spaces in the future of finance, complex applications in these ecosystems, like AMMs, borrow/lends and zK mixers, **are not interoperable with native BTC**. Enter SUBFROST.

SUBFROST exists to issue two BTC synthetics, crucial to a competitive DeFi ecosystem on Bitcoin, and both of which already carry heavy market demand:
1. **frBTC**: the first and only synthetic asset on Bitcoin, pegged 1:1 to BTC, to enable users to leverage their BTC across any application without ever leaving the Bitcoin blockchain.
2. **dxBTC**: the yield-bearing variant of BTC, enabling users to maintain full exposure to BTC while earning a yield in the simplest and most secure way possible.

Sound boring? Well, without a BTC synthetic like frBTC, there will be a lack of interest in Bitcoin DeFi and a continued reliance on trust-dependent, cross-chain options like wrapped BTC on Ethereum.
