# SUBFROST Proof-of-Stake

SUBFROST is secured by a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism where our network participants, known as signers, stake `FROST` **and** `frBTC`, to gain the right to participate in consensus. This economic stake incentivizes signers to act honestly and maintain the integrity of the network.

## The Role of Signers

Signers are responsible for:
-   **Validating Transactions:** Verifying the validity of transactions and state changes proposed by other signers.
-   **Securing the Peg:** Participating in the FROST threshold signature scheme to sign for the release of BTC during the unwrapping process.

The weight of a signers's influence in the consensus process (e.g., their probability of being chosen to propose a transaction) is proportional to the amount they have staked.

## Becoming A Signer
To become a signer in the FROST threshold signature group, a user must stake `dxFROST` tokens, which are the liquidity provider (LP) tokens for the `FROST`/`frBTC` pool on a decentralized exchange.

`dxFROST` is a yield-bearing, liquid staking token that a user recieves when they stake their `FROST` **and** `frBTC`.

`dxFROST` automatically accrues staking rewards and can be freely traded or used in other DeFi applications while the underlying `FROST` and `frBTC` remain staked, providing capital efficiency.

*This opportunity is not currently available to the public, but explained in Phase 2 on the [**frBTC - Roadmap**](../4-tokens/4.2-frBTC-Roadmap.mdx) page.*

## Security & Incentives

The PoS mechanism provides economic security to the network in several ways:

-   **Incentives:** Signers are rewarded for their participation with a share of the protocol's transaction fees. This provides a strong financial incentive to operate a node reliably and honestly.
-   **Slashing:** If a signer acts maliciously (e.g., by trying to double-spend or by signing a fraudulent transaction), their staked `FROST` **and** `frBTC` can be "slashed", meaning a portion of it is seized and burned. This threat of financial loss is a powerful deterrent against attacks.

This staking mechanism provides several benefits:

*   **Economic Security:** By requiring signers to have a significant economic stake in the system, the PoS model aligns their interests with the long-term health and security of the protocol.
*   **Liquidity:** The staking requirement ensures that there is always a deep pool of liquidity for the `FROST`/`frBTC` trading pair, which is essential for the health of the ecosystem.
*   **Alignment of Incentives:** By requiring signers to hold both `FROST` and `frBTC`, it ensures that they are invested in the long-term success of the entire SUBFROST protocol.

Through its roles in governance, value accrual, and security, the `FROST` token is an integral part of the SUBFROST protocol, ensuring its sustainability and growth. Learn more on the [**FROST token**](../4-tokens/4.6-FROST-Token.mdx) page.
