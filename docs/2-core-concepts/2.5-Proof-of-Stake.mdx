# SUBFROST Proof-of-Stake

SUBFROST is secured by a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism where our network participants, known as signers, stake `FROST` **and** `frBTC`, to gain the right to participate in consensus. This economic stake incentivizes signers to act honestly and maintain the integrity of the network.

## The Role of Signers

Signers are responsible for:
-   **Validating Transactions:** Verifying the validity of transactions and state changes proposed by other signers.
-   **Securing the Peg:** Participating in the FROST threshold signature scheme to sign for the release of BTC during the unwrapping process.

To become a signer, a user must acquire and stake both `FROST` and `frBTC` tokens. The weight of a signers's influence in the consensus process (e.g., their probability of being chosen to propose a transaction) is proportional to the amount they have staked.

## Tokens and Staking

The PoS system revolves around two primary tokens:

1. `FROST`: The native governance and staking token of the SUBFROST protocol.
2. `dxFROST`: A yield-bearing, liquid staking token that a user recieves when they stake their `FROST` **and** `frBTC`.

Note that `dxFROST` automatically accrues staking rewards and can be freely traded or used in other DeFi applications while the underlying `FROST` and `frBTC` remain staked, providing capital efficiency.

## Economic Security

The PoS mechanism provides economic security to the network in several ways:

-   **Incentives:** Signers are rewarded for their participation with a share of the network's transaction fees. This provides a strong financial incentive to operate a node reliably and honestly.
-   **Slashing:** If a signer acts maliciously (e.g., by trying to double-spend or by signing a fraudulent transaction), their staked `FROST` **and** `frBTC` can be "slashed", meaning a portion of it is seized and burned. This threat of financial loss is a powerful deterrent against attacks.

By requiring signers to have a significant economic stake in the system, the PoS model aligns their interests with the long-term health and security of the network.

## Staking and Security

The `FROST` token also plays a crucial role in the security of the SUBFROST protocol. To become a signer in the FROST threshold signature group, a user must stake `dxFROST` tokens, which are the liquidity provider (LP) tokens for the `FROST`/`frBTC` pool on a decentralized exchange.

This staking mechanism provides several benefits:

*   **Economic Security:** By requiring signers to have a significant economic stake in the system, it disincentivizes malicious behavior. If a signer misbehaves, their staked `dxFROST` can be slashed. This includes slashing **native BTC**.
*   **Liquidity:** The staking requirement ensures that there is always a deep pool of liquidity for the `FROST`/`frBTC` trading pair, which is essential for the health of the ecosystem.
*   **Alignment of Incentives:** By requiring signers to hold both `FROST` and `frBTC`, it ensures that they are invested in the long-term success of the entire SUBFROST protocol.

Through its roles in governance, value accrual, and security, the `FROST` token is an integral part of the SUBFROST protocol, ensuring its long-term sustainability and growth.
