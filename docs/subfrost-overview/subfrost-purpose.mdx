# Purpose of SUBFROST
Bitcoin DeFi is one of the most promising spaces in finance. However, native BTC is **not** compatible with complex applications built on Bitcoin L1 ecosystems, like AMMs, borrow/lends and zK mixers.

SUBFROST exists to issue two Defi-compatible BTC synthetics, crucial to a competitive DeFi ecosystem on Bitcoin:
1. **frBTC**: the first and only synthetic asset pegged 1:1 to BTC on Bitcoin, enabling users to leverage their BTC across any application without ever leaving the Bitcoin blockchain.
2. **dxBTC**: the yield-bearing variant of BTC, enabling users to maintain full exposure to BTC while earning a yield in the simplest and most secure way possible.

## What is SUBFROST?
SUBFROST is a decentralized custodian that enables a trustless DeFi ecosystem on Bitcoin L1. 

It operates as a [**Layer-0**](../developer-guide/technical-overview), designed to issue BTC synthetic assets directly onto Bitcoin via metaprotocol execution layers like Alkanes, BRC 2.0, etc.

Sound boring? Well, without a BTC synthetic like `frBTC`, there will be a lack of adoption in Bitcoin DeFi and a continued reliance on trust-dependent, cross-chain options like wrapped BTC on Ethereum.
