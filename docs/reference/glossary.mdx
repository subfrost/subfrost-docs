# Glossary

*   **FROST:** Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold. A threshold signature scheme that allows a large, dynamic set of signers to collectively create a single Schnorr signature without any single signer ever possessing the full private key.
*   **ROAST:** Robust Asynchronous Schnorr Threshold. An optimization of FROST that allows for a non-interactive signing session, assuming a single round of pre-computation has already been performed.
*   **`subp2p`:** The foundational peer-to-peer networking layer of the SUBFROST ecosystem.
*   **`subrelay`:** A critical component of the SUBFROST networking stack that acts as a rendezvous point, a traffic relay, and a name registrar for the `subp2p` network.
*   **`subproxy`:** A versatile tool that acts as a bridge between the `subp2p` network and the traditional internet.
*   **`subtun`:** A powerful component that creates a secure, peer-to-peer VPN over the `subp2p` network.
*   **`frBTC`:** The Bitcoin DeFi-compatible asset pegged 1:1 to BTC and interoperable across every DeFi ecosystem on Bitcoin L1.
*   **`dxBTC`:** A yield-generating synthetic Bitcoin asset.
*   **`FROST` Token:** The governance and utility token of the SUBFROST protocol
*   **`subfrost-core`:** The core logic of the SUBFROST protocol.
*   **`subfrost-runtime`:** The core of the SUBFROST node. It is a WASM program that contains the consensus logic for the SUBFROST protocol.
*   **`subrail`:** The high-performance WebAssembly (WASM) runtime at the heart of the SUBFROST ecosystem.
*   **`subswap`:** A suite of commands for interacting with the Automated Market Maker (AMM) functionality of the Alkanes metaprotocol.
*   **Keystore:** A file that securely stores all the sensitive cryptographic material for a user.
*   **Schnorr Signature:** A type of digital signature scheme that is known for its simplicity, provable security, and linearity.
*   **Gossipsub:** A pub/sub (publish/subscribe) protocol where peers can subscribe to topics and receive messages that are published to those topics.
*   **Microservices:** A set of small, independent services that communicate with each other over a secure and resilient network.
*   **AMM:** Automated Market Maker. A type of decentralized exchange that relies on a mathematical formula to price assets.
*   **Metaprotocol:** A protocol that is built on top of another protocol.
*   **Runestone:** A message that is embedded in an `OP_RETURN` output of a Bitcoin transaction.
*   **Alkanes:** A metaprotocol that is built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain.
*   **`OP_RETURN`:** An opcode in the Bitcoin scripting language that allows you to embed a small amount of data in a transaction.
*   **WASM:** WebAssembly. A binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine.
*   **`wasip2`:** A standardized interface for running WebAssembly modules on a variety of systems.
*   **TUN Device:** A virtual network interface that, instead of receiving packets from a physical medium, receives them from a user-space program.
*   **SOCKS5:** A proxy protocol that allows you to route your traffic through a proxy server.
*   **Reverse Proxy:** A proxy server that retrieves resources on behalf of a client from one or more servers.
*   **DKG:** Distributed Key Generation. A ceremony where a group of participants collaboratively generate a single group public key, while each participant only holds a secret share of the corresponding private key.
*   **ASCII Armoring:** The process of encoding binary data into a human-readable text format.
*   **PBKDF2:** Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2. A computationally intensive algorithm that makes it very difficult for an attacker to guess a passphrase.
*   **AES-GCM:** Advanced Encryption Standard in Galois/Counter Mode. A modern, authenticated encryption cipher that provides both confidentiality and integrity.
*   **Multi-Transport Support:** The ability to operate in a variety of network environments.
*   **mDNS:** Multicast DNS. A protocol that allows peers to discover each other on a local network without the need for a central server.
*   **Kademlia DHT:** A distributed hash table (DHT) that is used for discovering peers on the public internet.
*   **NAT Traversal:** The process of allowing peers behind firewalls and NATs to connect to each other.
*   **AutoNAT:** A protocol that allows a peer to discover its own public IP address.
*   **Hole Punching (DCUtR):** A technique that allows two peers behind NATs to establish a direct connection with the help of a relay.
*   **Circuit Relay:** A technique that allows two peers to communicate with each other through a relay when a direct connection cannot be established.
*   **`SUBFROSTNetworkBehaviour`:** A composite `libp2p` `NetworkBehaviour` that combines all the different protocols and behaviors used by SUBFROST.
*   **`gossipsub`:** A pub/sub (publish/subscribe) protocol where peers can subscribe to topics and receive messages that are published to those topics.
*   **`mdns`:** A protocol that allows peers to discover each other on a local network without the need for a central server.
*   **`kademlia`:** A distributed hash table (DHT) that is used for discovering peers on the public internet.
*   **`relay_client` and `relay_server`:** The client and server components of the circuit relay protocol.

*   **`identify`:** A protocol for discovering the public address of a peer.
*   **`autonat`:** A protocol for determining if a peer is behind a NAT.
*   **`ping`:** A protocol for checking the liveness of a peer.
*   **`request_response`:** A protocol for simple request-response interactions.
*   **`proxy_stream`:** A custom protocol for creating generic, proxied duplex streams between peers.
*   **`MetashrewProvider`:** A trait that abstracts the connection to a "metashrew" index.
*   **`SUBFROSTWasmRunner`:** A trait that defines the interface for running the core consensus logic, which is compiled to WASM.
