# `frBTC` Overview
## Interoperable Wrapped BTC of Bitcoin L1

`frBTC` is the Bitcoin DeFi-compatible asset pegged 1:1 to BTC and interoperable across every DeFi ecosystem on Bitcoin L1.

This is achieved through a trust-minimized process that locks BTC on the Bitcoin mainnet (Layer-1) and **atomically** mints a corresponding amount of `frBTC` for the user.

SUBFROST launched on Bitcoin mainnet in Q4 2025. Alkanes (October) & BRC2.0 (December).

## How can I use frBTC?

:::tip FOR THE FIRST TIME
Users can perform a **single** signing process to enter advanced DeFi apps on Bitcoin L1 with native BTC, completely abstracting-away the need to wrap their BTC first.
:::

The example below illustrates a user swapping native **BTC** to a USD stablecoin (or other token), atomically, in a decentralized, permissionless manner.

`frBTC` is live on Alkanes and BRC2.0, and we have already begun development to implement it on Arch & MIDL.
