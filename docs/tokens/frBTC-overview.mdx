# `frBTC` Overview
## Interoperable Wrapped BTC of Bitcoin L1

`frBTC` is the Bitcoin DeFi-compatible asset pegged 1:1 to BTC and interoperable across every DeFi ecosystem on Bitcoin L1.

This is achieved through a trust-minimized process that locks BTC on the Bitcoin mainnet (Layer-1) and **atomically** mints a corresponding amount of `frBTC` for the user.

## How can I use frBTC?

SUBFROST has launched `frBTC` on mainnet through partner integrations, like the OYL AMM, iDclub, Ordiscan, and Satonomy, on Alkanes.

Additionally, frBTC is live on BRC2.0 Signet and can be found in the Best In Slot AMM, enabling *instant* swaps with solana-like speed.

:::tip FOR THE FIRST TIME
Users can perform a **single** signing process to enter advanced DeFi apps on Bitcoin L1 with native BTC, completely abstracting-away the need to wrap their BTC first.

The example below illustrates a user swapping native **BTC** to a USD stablecoin (or other token), atomically, in a decentralized, permissionless manner.
