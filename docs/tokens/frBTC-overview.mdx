# `frBTC` Overview
## Interoperable Wrapped BTC of Bitcoin L1

`frBTC` is the Bitcoin DeFi-compatible asset pegged 1:1 to BTC and interoperable across every DeFi ecosystem on Bitcoin L1.

This is achieved through a trust-minimized process that locks BTC on the Bitcoin mainnet (Layer-1) and **atomically** mints a corresponding amount of `frBTC` for the user.

## How can I use frBTC?

SUBFROST will first launch `frBTC` wrapping through partner integrations, like the OYL AMM, iDclub, Ordiscan, Satonomy, and others on Alkanes. This allows users to conveniently wrap/unwrap their BTC without leaving these DeFi applications.

Even better, teams are already collaborating to integrate the `frBTC` wrap contract into the front of their transactions.

:::danger FOR THE FIRST TIME, ACROSS ANY BLOCKCHAIN
Users can perform a **single transaction** to enter advanced DeFi apps on Bitcoin L1 with native BTC, completely abstracting-away the need to wrap their BTC first.

The example below illustrates a user swapping native **BTC** to a USD stablecoin (or other token), atomically, in a decentralized, permissionless manner. Secured by Bitcoin consensus + FROST & ROAST cryptography.

`frBTC` is live on Alkanes in ALPHA, and our team has already begun building it into **BRC 2.0** (as the 6-byte "fr-BTC" ticker) and **Arch Network** (via the Titan Indexer).
