# SUBFROST Consensus Overview

SUBFROST uses signal-based reactive consensus for distributed coordination across blockchains.

## Architecture

```
L0 Program (WASI-P2) ← Pure functional WASM
    ↓ (virtual filesystem I/O)
Signal Filesystem ← /signals/input, /signals/state, /signals/output
    ↓ (read/write operations)
Host Runtime ← Handles all cryptography
    ↓
FROST/CGGMP24 → Multi-Chain Signing
```

## Signal System

### Input Signals
- `/signals/input/` - External blockchain events
- Example: `/signals/input/frbtc_burn_event`

### State Signals
- `/signals/state/` - Program state (persistent)
- Example: `/signals/state/last_processed_height`

### Output Signals
- `/signals/output/` - Proposed actions (signing requests)
- Example: `/signals/output/psbt`

### Logs
- `/logs/` - Debug and monitoring

## Execution Model

1. **Deterministic**: Pure functional WASM
2. **Reactive**: Triggered by signal changes
3. **Parallel**: Multiple signals evaluated concurrently
4. **Cryptography-Free**: Host handles all signing

## Example Flow

```wasm
// Detect blockchain event
read("/signals/input/burn_event") 
    ↓
// Process and prepare transaction
compute_transaction()
    ↓
// Request signing
write("/signals/output/psbt", psbt_bytes)
    ↓
// Host coordinates FROST signing
host_frost_sign()
    ↓
// Broadcast transaction
read("/signals/output/broadcast_tx")
```
