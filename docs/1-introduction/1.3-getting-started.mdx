# Getting Started

This guide is intended for developers who want to build on, or contribute to, the SUBFROST protocol.

To start, we will walk you through the process of setting up the necessary tools to interact with the protocol. You will install the `subfrost-node` to connect to the network and the `subrail-cli` CLI for user-level interactions like managing assets.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must have the Rust programming language and its package manager, Cargo, installed on your system. If you don't have them, follow the official instructions at [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

You will also need Git to clone the required repositories.

## 1. Install `subfrost-node`

The `subfrost-node` is the core software that runs the SUBFROST network. It handles consensus, block production, and communication with other nodes.

First, clone the `subfrost` repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/subfrost/subfrost.git
cd subfrost
```

Next, build the `subfrost-node` binary using Cargo. This command compiles the `subfrost-node` crate in release mode for optimal performance.

```bash
cargo build --release --package subfrost-node
```

The compiled binary will be located at `target/release/subfrost-node`. For ease of use, you should move it to a directory in your system's `PATH`, such as `/usr/local/bin`.

```bash
sudo mv target/release/subfrost-node /usr/local/bin/
```

Verify the installation by checking the version:

```bash
subfrost-node --version
```

## 2. Install `subrail-cli` CLI

The `subrail-cli` CLI is the primary tool for users to interact with the SUBFROST network. It allows you to create wallets, check balances, and initiate transactions like wrapping and unwrapping `frBTC`.

Clone the `subrail-cli` repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/subfrost/subrail-cli.git
cd subrail-cli
```

Build the `subrail-cli` binary:

```bash
cargo build --release --package subrail-cli
```

Move the compiled binary to your `PATH`:

```bash
sudo mv target/release/subrail-cli /usr/local/bin/
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
subrail-cli --version
```

## Next Steps

With `subfrost-node` and `subrail-cli` installed, you are now ready to run a node and interact with the network. The next sections will guide you through running a node and performing common operations.
