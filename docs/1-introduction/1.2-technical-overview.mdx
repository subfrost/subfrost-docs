# Technical Overview

SUBFROST operates as a Layer-0, building fraud proofs as ZK circuits to ensure the integrity of its operations. 
At its core, SUBFROST uses the **<a href={useBaseUrl('/core-concepts/2.2-frost-and-roast')}>FROST</a>** (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold) and **<a href={useBaseUrl('/core-concepts/2.2-frost-and-roast')}>ROAST</a>** (Robust Asynchronous Schnorr Threshold) signature schemes, allowing signing groups of up to 255 participants to collectively sign transactions. 
This decentralized approach to custody is managed by a peer-to-peer network built on QUIC and libp2p, ensuring robust and secure communication.

In the following pages, we will cover the core components of SUBFROST, including but not limited to:

- **<a href={useBaseUrl('/core-concepts/2.2-frost-and-roast')}>FROST & ROAST Cryptography</a>**: The threshold signature schemes that power decentralized custody.
- **<a href={useBaseUrl('/core-concepts/2.1-alkanes')}>Alkanes Metaprotocol</a>**: The bridge that pegs SUBFROST to the Bitcoin blockchain.
- **<a href={useBaseUrl('/developer-guide/5.3-subrail')}>Subrail</a>**: The WASM runtime for executing consensus-critical logic.
- **<a href={useBaseUrl('/subfrost-networking/3.1-introduction-to-subp2p')}>Peer-to-Peer Networking</a>**: The communication layer built on QUIC and libp2p.
