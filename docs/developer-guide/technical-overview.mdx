title: Technical Overview

**As of 9/9/2025, some information in these docs may not be fully up to date. Future updates will outline enhancements to the security and value of the SUBFROST protocol or provide additional technical detail.**

SUBFROST operates as a Layer-0, building fraud proofs as ZK circuits to ensure the integrity of its operations. 
At its core, SUBFROST uses the **[FROST](./frost-protocol)** (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold) signature scheme, allowing signing groups of up to 255 participants to collectively sign transactions. 
This decentralized approach to custody is managed by a peer-to-peer network built on QUIC and libp2p, ensuring robust and secure communication.

We will cover the core components, including:

- **[FROST Protocol](./frost-protocol)**: The threshold signature scheme that powers decentralized custody.
- **[Alkanes Metaprotocol](./alkanes)**: The bridge that pegs SUBFROST to the Bitcoin protocol.
- **[Subrail](./subrail)**: The WASM runtime for executing consensus-critical logic.
- **Peer-to-Peer Networking**: The communication layer built on QUIC and libp2p.
