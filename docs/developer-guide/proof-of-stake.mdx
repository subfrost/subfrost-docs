# SUBFROST's Proof-of-Stake (PoS)

SUBFROST is secured by a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism where our network participants, known as signers, stake the native `FROST` token AND 'frBTC', to gain the right to participate in consensus. This economic stake incentivizes signers to act honestly and maintain the integrity of the network.

## The Role of Signers

Signers are responsible for:
-   **Validating Transactions:** Verifying the validity of transactions and state changes proposed by other signers.
-   **Securing the Peg:** Participating in the FROST threshold signature scheme to sign for the release of BTC during the unwrapping process.

To become a signer, a user must acquire and stake both `FROST` and 'frBTC' tokens. The weight of a signers's influence in the consensus process (e.g., their probability of being chosen to propose a transaction) is proportional to the amount of 'FROST' they have staked.

## Tokens and Staking

The PoS system revolves around two primary tokens:

-   **`FROST`:** The native governance and staking token of the SUBFROST network. It is used to pay for transaction fees and is the primary asset used for staking.

-   **`dxFROST`:** A yield-bearing, liquid staking token. When a user stakes their `FROST`, they receive `dxFROST` in return. This token represents their staked position and automatically accrues staking rewards. Because `dxFROST` is a liquid token, it can be freely traded or used in other DeFi applications while the underlying `FROST` remains staked, providing capital efficiency.

## Economic Security

The PoS mechanism provides economic security to the network in several ways:

-   **Incentives:** Signers are rewarded for their participation with a share of the network's transaction fees and newly emitted `FROST` tokens. This provides a strong financial incentive to operate a node reliably and honestly.
-   **Slashing:** If a signer acts maliciously (e.g., by trying to double-spend or by signing a fraudulent transaction), their staked `FROST` can be "slashed," meaning a portion of it is seized and burned. This threat of financial loss is a powerful deterrent against attacks.

By requiring signers to have a significant economic stake in the system, the PoS model aligns their interests with the long-term health and security of the network.
