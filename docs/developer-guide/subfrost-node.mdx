This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how to run a `subfrost-node` and participate in the SUBFROST network.

## Introduction

A `subfrost-node` is a full node that participates in the SUBFROST network. It stores the entire state of the network, validates all transactions, and participates in the FROST threshold signing process. By running a `subfrost-node`, you contribute to the decentralization and security of the network.

## Running a Node

To run a `subfrost-node`, you will need to have the `subfrost-node` binary installed. You can then run the node with the following command:

```bash
subfrost-node --chain regtest --validator
```

This will start a validator node on the regtest network. The node will begin syncing with the network, validating transactions, and participating in the FROST threshold signing process.

### Configuration

The `subfrost-node` can be configured using a variety of command-line flags. For a full list of available options, run the following command:

```bash
subfrost-node --help
```

### Staking

To become a validator on the SUBFROST network, you must stake `dxFROST` tokens. The top 255 stakers are selected as signers, and a 2/3 threshold (170 of 255) is required for signing operations.

## P2P Protocol

The `subfrost-node` uses a sophisticated P2P protocol based on `libp2p` for communication between nodes. The protocol stack includes:

-   **Transport Protocols:** QUIC for encrypted, reliable, and multiplexed connections.
-   **Discovery and Routing Protocols:** Kademlia DHT for peer discovery and routing.
-   **NAT Traversal Protocols:** Circuit relay and DCUTR for connectivity between peers behind NATs.
-   **Messaging Protocols:** Gossipsub for efficient message propagation and a direct message fallback for critical messages.

This robust P2P protocol ensures reliable and secure communication between nodes, even in challenging network conditions.
