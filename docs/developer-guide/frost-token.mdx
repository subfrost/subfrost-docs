The SUBFROST protocol token. All protocol fees are used to buy & burn 'FROST', driving value to holders by increasing demand and decreasing supply.

Example to illustrate this process:
1. A user wraps 1 BTC to frBTC and they pay a small fee of 0.10% to do this
2. SUBFROST collects this 0.001 BTC fee and automatically buys FROST tokens from the open market
3. SUBFROST then burns these FROST tokens

**Tokenomics:** SUBFROST aims to be a foundational piller of the DeFi ecosystem on Bitcoin L1, maximizing value creation for holders and stakers of FROST for as long as Bitcoin miners secure the blockchain.

Currently, this 1B FROST (expected) is allocated in the following ways:
- 15% to investors where equity converts to 'FROST' (we are raising!)
- 85% to team, builder, and community incentive programs to maximize alignment between incentives and long-term outcomes of SUBFROST and Bitcoin DeFi at large.
