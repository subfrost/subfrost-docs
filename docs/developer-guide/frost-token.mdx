The SUBFROST protocol token. All protocol fees are used to buy & burn 'FROST', driving value to holders by increasing demand and decreasing supply.

Example to illustrate this process:
1. A user wraps 1 BTC to frBTC and they pay a small fee of 0.10% to do this
2. SUBFROST collects this 0.001 BTC fee and automatically buys FROST tokens from the open market
3. SUBFROST then burns these FROST tokens

**Tokenomics:** SUBFROST will be a foundational pillar of the DeFi ecosystems on Bitcoin L1, therefore, the 1B FROST (expected) is allocated across the team, contributors, and community programs to maximize alignment between incentives and long-term outcomes of SUBFROST and Bitcoin DeFi at large.
