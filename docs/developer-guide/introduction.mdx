# Developer Guide Introduction

This guide provides a deep dive into the technical architecture of the SUBFROST ecosystem. SUBFROST is a decentralized custodian and Layer 0 system for Bitcoin, enabling a trustless DeFi ecosystem through the use of ZK fraud proofs.

This guide is intended for developers who want to build on, or contribute to, the SUBFROST platform. We will cover the core components, including:

- **FROST Protocol**: The threshold signature scheme that powers decentralized custody.
- **Alkanes Metaprotocol**: The bridge that pegs SUBFROST to the Bitcoin protocol.
- **Subrail**: The WASM runtime for executing consensus-critical logic.
- **Peer-to-Peer Networking**: The communication layer built on QUIC and libp2p.
