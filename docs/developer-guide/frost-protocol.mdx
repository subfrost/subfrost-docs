# FROST Protocol

**FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold)** is the cryptographic cornerstone of the SUBFROST protocol. It is a threshold signature scheme that allows a large, dynamic set of validators to collectively create a single Schnorr signature without any single validator ever possessing the full private key.

## How it Secures the Peg

The two-way peg between Bitcoin and SUBFROST is maintained by a large pool of `FROST` and `frBTC` token stakers. The BTC that collateralizes `frBTC` is held in a single Bitcoin address whose private key is managed by the entire validator set using the FROST protocol.

1.  **Distributed Key Generation (DKG):** When the validator set is formed or changed, the validators perform a DKG ceremony. This is an interactive protocol where each validator generates a *share* of a private key. At the end of the ceremony, a single public key is created for the group, but no individual validator holds the corresponding private key. Each validator only has their own secret share.

2.  **Threshold Signatures:** To spend the BTC held in the multisig address (i.e., to process an unwrap request), a threshold `t` of the total `n` validators must cooperate.
    -   A user broadcasts an unwrap transaction on the SUBFROST protocol.
    -   Once finalized, a quorum of validators (at least `t` of them) will each use their private key *share* to create a *partial signature*.
    -   These partial signatures are then aggregated into a single, valid Schnorr signature for the Bitcoin transaction that releases the BTC to the user.

## Key Advantages

-   **No Single Point of Failure:** The full private key never exists in one place, making it impossible for a single compromised validator (or a small group) to steal the funds.
-   **Scalability:** The protocol supports a large and dynamic set of validators. New validators can join and old ones can leave without needing to regenerate the main key, only requiring an update to the key shares.
-   **Efficiency:** FROST is optimized to be non-interactive in the signing phase (after an initial setup round), reducing the communication overhead between validators and making the signing process fast.

This trust-minimized setup is a significant improvement over federated or centralized peg mechanisms, providing a much higher degree of security and decentralization for the assets locked on the protocol.
