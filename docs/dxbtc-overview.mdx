# dxBTC Overview
## Bitcoin High Yield Savings

`dxBTC` is the liquid staking, yield-bearing synthetic asset of Bitcoin Layer-1:

1. User signs a **single** Bitcoin transaction to stake their **native BTC** in the SUBFROST yield vault. The user receives `dxBTC`, which represents their staked BTC.
2. Their BTC is wrapped to `frBTC` and deployed into market-neutral LP strategies and over-collateralized lending protocols across Bitcoin L1, earning yield regardless of BTC price movement.
3. This yield is then passed back to stakers in the form of **native BTC**, which the user can check at any time.
4. User signs a **single** Bitcoin transaction to unstake their **native BTC** and burn their `dxBTC`.

These yield vaults will be deployed across Alkanes, BRC 2.0, OP_NET, Arch, and any other programmable ecosystem that launches on Bitcoin mainnet.

This economic model is **already proven** on other blockchains like Ethereum and Solana and can be dramatically simplified for the end user. SUBFROST will enable users to earn yield on their **native BTC** in the **simplest** & **most-secure** way possible.

**Tokenomics:** The exact amount of circulating `dxBTC` will be the exact amount of BTC deployed to SUBFROST's yield vault.
