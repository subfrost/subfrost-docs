# dxBTC: The Bitcoin High Yield Savings Account

`dxBTC` is the liquid staking, yield-bearing synthetic asset of Bitcoin Layer-1:

1. Users sign a **single** Bitcoin transaction to stake their **native BTC** in a yield vault.
2. Their BTC is wrapped to frBTC and deployed into trusted protocols to earn a yield in the safest way possible, typically market-neutral LPs and over-collateralized loans.
2. This yield is then passed back to stakers in the form of **native BTC**.

These yield vaults will be deployed across Alkanes, BRC-20 2.0, OP_NET, Arch, and any other programmable ecosystem that launches on Bitcoin mainnet.

This model is already proven on other blockchains like Ethereum and Solana and we still believe it can be dramatically simplified for the end user. More information on dxBTC coming soon.
