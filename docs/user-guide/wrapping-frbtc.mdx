# Wrapping and Unwrapping frBTC

One of the core functionalities of the SUBFROST ecosystem is the ability to create `frBTC`, a synthetic asset pegged 1:1 to Bitcoin. This is achieved through a trust-minimized process that locks BTC on the Bitcoin mainnet and mints a corresponding amount of `frBTC` on the SUBFROST sidechain.

This guide will walk you through the process using the `deezel` CLI.

## The Wrapping Process Explained

Wrapping involves creating a special Bitcoin transaction that performs two actions simultaneously:
1.  **Locks BTC:** Your BTC is sent to a secure, multisignature address controlled by the SUBFROST validators.
2.  **Mints frBTC:** An `OP_RETURN` output in the same transaction contains instructions for the Alkanes metaprotocol to mint an equivalent amount of `frBTC` and assign it to your SUBFROST address.

## 1. Generate a SUBFROST Wallet

If you haven't already, you need a SUBFROST wallet to receive your `frBTC`.

```bash
deezel wallet create
```

This command will generate a new wallet and display your address. Keep your mnemonic phrase safe and private.

## 2. Initiate the Wrap

To wrap BTC, you will use the `deezel wrap` command. This command constructs and broadcasts the necessary Bitcoin transaction.

You need to specify three things:
-   The amount of BTC to wrap.
-   Your SUBFROST address (where the `frBTC` will be sent).
-   The address for receiving transaction change (a regular Bitcoin address).

```bash
# Example: Wrap 0.1 BTC
deezel wrap --amount 0.1 --to <your-subfrost-address> --change <your-bitcoin-change-address>
```

`deezel` will then guide you through the process, which will involve signing the transaction with a compatible Bitcoin wallet.

## 3. Confirm Your `frBTC` Balance

After the Bitcoin transaction is confirmed, the `frBTC` will be minted on the SUBFROST chain. You can check your balance using `deezel`.

```bash
deezel balance --address <your-subfrost-address>
```

You should see your new `frBTC` balance reflected.

## The Unwrapping Process

Unwrapping is the reverse process: `frBTC` is burned on the SUBFROST chain, and the equivalent amount of BTC is released from the multisig address back to a Bitcoin address you specify.

## 1. Initiate the Unwrap

Use the `deezel unwrap` command, specifying the amount of `frBTC` to unwrap and the destination Bitcoin address.

```bash
# Example: Unwrap 0.1 frBTC
deezel unwrap --amount 0.1 --to <your-destination-bitcoin-address>
```

This will create and broadcast a SUBFROST transaction that burns your `frBTC`.

## 2. Receive Your BTC

Once the SUBFROST transaction is finalized, the validators will cooperatively sign a Bitcoin transaction to release the locked BTC to your specified destination address. This process is automated and secured by the FROST protocol.
