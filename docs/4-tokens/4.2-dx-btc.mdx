# `dxBTC`: Decentralized Bitcoin Yield

`dxBTC` is a yield-generating synthetic Bitcoin asset built on top of the Subfrost ecosystem. It is designed to provide Bitcoin holders with a way to earn a sustainable yield on their assets in a trustless and decentralized manner.

## `frBTC` + Yield

At its core, `dxBTC` is an alkane that locks up `frBTC`. The Subfrost governance, composed of FROST token holders, acts as a decentralized strategist, deploying the locked `frBTC` into various yield-generating strategies. These strategies can include:

*   **Providing liquidity to decentralized exchanges (DEXs):** The `frBTC` can be used to provide liquidity to `frBTC`/`BTC` or other trading pairs on decentralized exchanges, earning trading fees.
*   **Lending:** The `frBTC` can be lent out on decentralized lending platforms to earn interest.
*   **Cross-chain strategies:** The `frBTC` can be bridged to other blockchain ecosystems to participate in yield farming opportunities.

The profits generated from these strategies are then distributed back to the `dxBTC` holders, allowing them to earn a passive income on their Bitcoin.

## Trustless Bitcoin Staking

`dxBTC` enables a form of trustless Bitcoin staking. By converting their `frBTC` into `dxBTC`, users are effectively staking their Bitcoin in the Subfrost ecosystem and earning a share of the yield generated by the Subfrost governance. This provides a way for Bitcoin holders to put their assets to work without having to sell them or trust a centralized custodian.

## The Role of Subfrost Governance

The Subfrost governance plays a crucial role in the `dxBTC` ecosystem. The governance is responsible for:

*   **Selecting and managing yield-generating strategies:** The governance researches, vets, and selects the most promising and secure yield-generating strategies for the locked `frBTC`.
*   **Monitoring and rebalancing:** The governance continuously monitors the performance of the selected strategies and rebalances the portfolio as needed to optimize yield and manage risk.
*   **Distributing profits:** The governance ensures that the profits generated from the yield-generating strategies are distributed fairly to all `dxBTC` holders.

By combining the security and decentralization of Subfrost with the yield-generating potential of DeFi, `dxBTC` provides a powerful new tool for Bitcoin holders to grow their wealth.
