# `frBTC` Overview
## The Interoperable Wrapped BTC of Bitcoin L1

`frBTC` is the Bitcoin DeFi-compatible asset pegged 1:1 to BTC and interoperable across every DeFi ecosystem on Bitcoin L1.

This is achieved through a trust-minimized process that locks BTC on the Bitcoin mainnet (Layer-1) and **atomically** mints a corresponding amount of `frBTC` for the user.

## How to Get frBTC

SUBFROST will first launch `frBTC` wrapping through partner integrations, like OYL, Ordiscan, Satonomy, etc. on Alkanes. This will allow users to conveniently wrap/unwrap their BTC without leaving these DeFi applications.

Additionally, the team is already collaborating with these partners to integrate the `frBTC` wrap contract into the front of their transactions. This enables users, in a **single transaction**, to enter advanced DeFi apps on Bitcoin L1 with native BTC, **completely abstracting-away** the need to wrap their BTC first.

This is the first time in history, across any blockchain, that a user can swap native **BTC** to something like a USD stablecoin, atomically, in an entirely decentralized manner with minimal trust assumptions (Bitcoin consensus + FROST & ROAST cryptography).

`frBTC` will be live on Alkanes shortly in ALPHA, and our team has already begun building it into BRC 2.0 (as the 6-byte "fr-BTC" ticker) and Arch Network (via the Titan Indexer). 

## Wrapping Overview

Wrapping involves creating a Bitcoin transaction that performs two actions simultaneously:
1.  **Lock BTC:** Your BTC is sent to a secure, multisignature address controlled by the SUBFROST signers.
2.  **Mint frBTC:** An `OP_RETURN` output in the same transaction contains instructions for the Alkanes metaprotocol to mint an equivalent amount of `frBTC` and assign it to your Bitcoin address.

**Fee:** A small -0.3% fee is charged on every on-chain wrap.

## Unwrapping Overview

Unwrapping is the reverse process, the SUBFROST signers will cooperatively sign a Bitcoin transaction which is automated and secured by the SUBFROST protocol:
1. **Burn frBTC:** `frBTC` is burned on the SUBFROST protocol.
2. **Unlock BTC:** An equivalent amount of BTC is released from the multisig address back to the Bitcoin address the user specifies (typically their wallet).

**Incentive:** Rather than a fee, a +0.1% INCENTIVE is provided on every unwrap transaction.
