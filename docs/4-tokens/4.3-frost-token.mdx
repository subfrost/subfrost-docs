# The FROST Token

The `FROST` token is the governance and utility token of the Subfrost ecosystem. It is designed to align the incentives of all participants in the network and to capture a portion of the value created by the Subfrost protocol.

## Governance

`FROST` token holders are the governors of the Subfrost system. They are responsible for:

*   **Managing the `dxBTC` treasury:** `FROST` holders vote on which yield-generating strategies to deploy the `frBTC` held in the `dxBTC` alkane.
*   **Setting fees:** The governance can vote to adjust the fees for bridging BTC to `frBTC` and for other services on the network.
*   **Upgrading the protocol:** `FROST` holders can vote on proposals to upgrade the Subfrost protocol and its various components.

This decentralized governance model ensures that the Subfrost protocol is always aligned with the interests of its users and stakeholders.

## Value Accrual

The `FROST` token is designed to accrue value from the economic activity on the Subfrost network. The primary source of value accrual is from the fees generated by the bridge between native Bitcoin and `frBTC`.

A small fee is charged for every `wrap` (BTC to `frBTC`) and `unwrap` (`frBTC` to BTC) operation. A portion of these fees is used to buy back `FROST` tokens from the open market and burn them, creating a deflationary pressure on the token supply.

## Staking and Security

The `FROST` token also plays a crucial role in the security of the Subfrost network. To become a signer in the FROST threshold signature group, a user must stake `dxFROST` tokens, which are the liquidity provider (LP) tokens for the `FROST`/`frBTC` pool on a decentralized exchange.

This staking mechanism provides several benefits:

*   **Economic Security:** By requiring signers to have a significant economic stake in the system, it disincentivizes malicious behavior. If a signer misbehaves, their staked `dxFROST` can be slashed.
*   **Liquidity:** The staking requirement ensures that there is always a deep pool of liquidity for the `FROST`/`frBTC` trading pair, which is essential for the health of the ecosystem.
*   **Alignment of Incentives:** By requiring signers to hold both `FROST` and `frBTC`, it ensures that they are invested in the long-term success of the entire Subfrost ecosystem.

Through its roles in governance, value accrual, and security, the `FROST` token is an integral part of the Subfrost protocol, ensuring its long-term sustainability and growth.

## `FROST` Token in Subfrost

The `subfrost-cli` provides a set of commands for staking `FROST` tokens and for participating in governance. These commands allow you to:

*   **Stake `dxFROST`:** The `subfrost-cli stake` command allows you to stake `dxFROST` tokens and become a signer in the FROST threshold signature group.
*   **Unstake `dxFROST`:** The `subfrost-cli unstake` command allows you to unstake `dxFROST` tokens and leave the FROST threshold signature group.
*   **Vote on proposals:** The `subfrost-cli governance vote` command allows you to vote on governance proposals.

### Staking `dxFROST`

Here is an example of how to use the `subfrost-cli` to stake `dxFROST` tokens:

```bash
subfrost-cli stake --amount 100.0
```

This command will stake 100.0 `dxFROST` tokens and make you a signer in the FROST threshold signature group. You will then be able to participate in FROST signing ceremonies and earn a share of the fees generated by the Subfrost protocol.
