SUBFROST operates as a Layer-0, building fraud proofs as ZK circuits to ensure the integrity of its operations. 
At its core, SUB[FROST](./developer-guide/frost-protocol) uses the **[FROST](./developer-guide/frost-protocol)** (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold) signature scheme, allowing signing groups of up to 255 participants to collectively sign transactions. 
This decentralized approach to custody is managed by a peer-to-peer network built on QUIC and libp2p, ensuring robust and secure communication. Further, SUB[FROST](./developer-guide/frost-protocol) is the first network to enforce honest behavior via slashing of the staker's BTC itself.

We will cover the core components, including:

- **[FROST](./developer-guide/frost-protocol) Protocol**: The threshold signature scheme that powers decentralized custody.
- **[Alkanes Metaprotocol](./developer-guide/alkanes)**: The bridge that pegs SUB[FROST](./developer-guide/frost-protocol) to the Bitcoin protocol.
- **[Subrail](./developer-guide/subrail)**: The WASM runtime for executing consensus-critical logic.
- **Peer-to-Peer Networking**: The communication layer built on QUIC and libp2p.
