# frBTC: Interoperable BTC Synthetic on Bitcoin L1

One of the core functionalities of the SUBFROST protocol is the ability to create `frBTC`, a synthetic asset pegged 1:1 to Bitcoin.

This is achieved through a trust-minimized process that locks BTC on the Bitcoin mainnet (Layer-1) and mints a corresponding amount of `frBTC` for the user.

frBTC should be live on Alkanes, BRC-20 2.0, OP_NET, Arch, etc. shortly after each one launches to mainnet. 

## Plan for frBTC

1. SUBFROST will first launch frBTC wrapping through partner integrations, like the OYL AMM on Alkanes. This will allow users to convienetly wrap their BTC without leaving these advanced DeFi applications.
2. Shortly after we will allow these partners to integrate the frBTC wrap contract into the front of their transactions. This will enable users, in a single transaction, to enter advanced DeFi apps on Bitcoin with native BTC, **completely abstracting-away the need to wrap their BTC first**.

This will be the first time in history, across any blockchain, that a user can swap native BTC to something like a USD stablecoin, in an entirely decentralized manner.

## The Wrapping Process

Wrapping involves creating a special Bitcoin transaction that performs two actions simultaneously:
1.  **Lock BTC:** Your BTC is sent to a secure, multisignature address controlled by the SUBFROST validators.
2.  **Mint frBTC:** An `OP_RETURN` output in the same transaction contains instructions for the Alkanes metaprotocol to mint an equivalent amount of `frBTC` and assign it to your SUBFROST address.

## The Unwrapping Process

Unwrapping is the reverse process, the SUBFROST validators will cooperatively sign a Bitcoin tx which is automated and secured by the SUBFROST protocol:
1. **Burn frBTC:** `frBTC` is burned on the SUBFROST protocol.
2. **Unlock BTC:** An equivalent amount of BTC is released from the multisig address back to the Bitcoin address the user specifies (typically their wallet).
