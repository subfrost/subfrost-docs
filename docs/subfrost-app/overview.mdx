# SUBFROST APP Overview

*The SUBFROST APP is currently in development and its interface is subject to change.*

The SUBFROST APP is designed to have the strongest user experience across crypto, without ever leaving the Bitcoin blockchain.

Our goal is to make interacting with Bitcoin DeFi as seamless as the top experiences found on Solana and Ethereum—while keeping everything settled natively on Bitcoin L1.

## Core Features

The SUBFROST APP will be used to showcase the best possible UX on Bitcoin L1:

### Swap

Trade between native BTC, stablecoins, popular assets across BTCFi ecos, and high-volume cross-chain assets with single-transaction execution. [Go to Swap →](/subfrost-app/swap)

### Vaults

Deposit your Bitcoin into automated yield strategies. Vaults handle liquidity provision, reward harvesting, and compounding automatically. [Go to Vaults →](/subfrost-app/vaults)

### Futures

Trade time-locked Bitcoin positions with deterministic pricing. Hold to expiry for 1:1 BTC redemption, or exercise early for a small premium. [Go to Futures →](/subfrost-app/futures)

### Wallet

Full-featured Bitcoin wallet supporting SegWit & Taproot addresses from popular browser extensions (Xverse, OKX, etc.) and a built-in self-custodial keystore option! [Go to Wallet →](/subfrost-app/wallet)

## Design Philosophy

- **Native BTC first** — Use your Bitcoin directly. Wrapping and unwrapping happens behind the scenes.
- **Bitcoin L1 settlement** — All trades settle on Bitcoin mainnet. No L2s, minimized trust assumptions.
- **Self-custody** — Your keys, your coins. We never have access to your funds.
- **Clean, intuitive UI** — Built for both newcomers and power users.

## Light & Dark Mode

Switch between light and dark themes based on your preference. The toggle is available in the top navigation bar and your choice persists across sessions.
