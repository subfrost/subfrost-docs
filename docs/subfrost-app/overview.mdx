# SUBFROST APP Overview

:::caution UI In Development
The SUBFROST APP interface is currently in development and subject to change.
:::

The SUBFROST APP is designed to be the best user experience in all of crypto. Our goal is to make interacting with Bitcoin DeFi as seamless as the top experiences found on Ethereum and Solana—while keeping everything settled natively on Bitcoin L1.

## Light & Dark Mode

Switch between light and dark themes based on your preference. The toggle is available in the top navigation bar and your choice persists across sessions.

## Core Features

The SUBFROST APP gives you access to everything you need for Bitcoin DeFi in one place:

### Swap

Trade between BTC, frBTC, stablecoins, and cross-chain assets with single-transaction execution. The AMM automatically routes through liquidity pools for best rates.

**Highlights:**
- Single-transaction swaps settled on Bitcoin L1
- Automatic routing for best rates
- Cross-chain support for ETH, SOL, ZEC, USDC, USDT
- BTC ↔ frBTC conversion at 1:1

### Vaults

Deposit your Bitcoin into automated yield strategies. Vaults handle liquidity provision, reward harvesting, and compounding automatically—you just deposit and earn.

**Planned Vaults (Coming Soon):**
- **dxBTC** — Earn yield on BTC/frBTC
- **veUSD** — Earn yield on USD
- **veDIESEL, veORDI** — Higher risk, higher yield options

## Design Philosophy

- **Native BTC first** — Use your Bitcoin directly. Wrapping and unwrapping happens behind the scenes.
- **Bitcoin L1 settlement** — All trades settle on Bitcoin mainnet. No L2s, no trust assumptions.
- **Self-custody** — Your keys, your coins. We never have access to your funds.
- **Clean, intuitive UI** — Built for both newcomers and power users.

## Getting Started

1. **Connect your wallet** — Click "Connect Wallet" in the top right. Choose a browser extension or create a browser keystore.
2. **Explore the dashboard** — See your balances and available actions.
3. **Start with a swap** — Try converting some BTC to frBTC to access DeFi features.
4. **Check out vaults** — Browse yield opportunities for your assets.
5. **Explore futures** — Trade time-locked Bitcoin positions.
