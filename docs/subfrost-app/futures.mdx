The Futures market lets you trade **ftrBTC**—time-locked Bitcoin positions with deterministic pricing. Hold to expiry for full redemption, or exercise early with a small premium.

## What is ftrBTC?

**ftrBTC** (Future Bitcoin) is a time-locked position where:
- You choose a lock period between **1-95 blocks**
- At expiry: **1 ftrBTC = 1 BTC** (full redemption)
- Early exercise: Pay a small premium that decreases as expiry approaches

## How Pricing Works

### The Premium

When you exercise ftrBTC before expiry, you pay a small premium. This premium:
- Is highest when the contract is new
- Decreases steadily as expiry approaches
- Reaches nearly zero at expiry

| Time to Expiry | Approximate Premium |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Just created | ~5% |
| Halfway | ~2-3% |
| Near expiry | ~0.1% |
| At expiry | ~0% |

### Market Price vs Exercise Price

- **Market Price**: What you pay to buy ftrBTC from other traders
- **Exercise Price**: What you receive when you redeem (deterministic based on time remaining)

:::tip Profit Strategy
Buy when the market price is below what the exercise price will be at your intended hold time, then hold until that point.

Use quick-select buttons: **25%** / **50%** / **75%** / **Max**

The interface automatically shows:
- **Total Yield** — Expected percentage return
- **Total Profit** — Profit in BTC
- **Investment (BTC)** — Amount you're investing

## Managing Positions

Switch to the **Positions** tab to view your holdings:

![Positions Table](/img/app/PositionsTable.png)

For each position you can see:
- **Contract** — Which ftrBTC contract
- **Amount (ftrBTC)** — How much you hold
- **Exercise Value** — What you'd receive if exercising now
- **Last Trade (Market)** — Most recent market price
- **Blocks Left** — Until contract expiry

### Exercising a Position

Click **Exercise** to redeem your ftrBTC for BTC. The exercise value moves deterministically as blocks pass—holding to expiry removes the time penalty (0% fee).


## Contract Details

- **Contract** — Contract identifier
- **Notional** — Amount in ftrBTC
- **Time to expiry** — Blocks remaining
- **Exercise now** — Current redemption value
- **Last market trade** — Most recent trade price
- **Behaviour** — How the exercise value changes over time

## Strategies

### Hold to Expiry

The simplest strategy—buy ftrBTC at a discount and hold until expiry for 1:1 redemption.

### Active Trading

Monitor market prices for contracts trading below their fair value. Buy undervalued contracts and either hold or sell when the price rises.

### For Miners

Futures can help smooth out mining revenue by locking in future value.

## Risk Considerations

:::warning Trading Risk
- Market prices can move against you
- Early exercise costs a premium
- Don't invest more than you can afford to hold until expiry
:::

| Risk | How to Manage |
|------|---------------|
| **Premium Cost** | Hold longer to reduce the premium |
| **Market Movement** | Don't chase prices, use limit orders |
| **Missing Expiry** | Set reminders, leave time buffer for transactions |

## Tips

- **Check multiple contracts** — Different contracts have different expiry times
- **Use the calculator** — Let the interface show you expected returns
- **Don't wait until the last moment** — Leave time for your transaction to confirm
- **Start small** — Understand the mechanics before committing large amounts
