# Vaults

:::caution UI In Development
The SUBFROST APP interface is currently in development and subject to change.
:::

Vaults provide automated DeFi strategies to earn yield on your Bitcoin and other supported tokens. Deposit your assets, and the vault handles the rest.

**Planned Vaults (Coming Soon):**
- **dxBTC** — Earn yield on BTC/frBTC
- **veUSD** — Earn yield on USD
- **veDIESEL, veORDI** — Higher risk, higher yield options

## What Are Vaults?

Vaults are automated yield strategies. Instead of manually:
- Providing liquidity to pools
- Harvesting rewards
- Rebalancing positions
- Compounding earnings

...vaults do all of this for you. You deposit, the vault works, you earn.

## Available Vaults

:::note Coming Soon
All vaults are currently in development. The vaults listed below will be available at launch.
:::

| Vault | Description | Risk |
|-------|-------------|------|
| **dxBTC Token** | Stake BTC/frBTC for pure BTC yield | Medium |
| **veUSD Vault** | Stake USD for boosted yield | Low-Medium |
| **veDIESEL Vault** | Stake DIESEL for boosted yield | Very High |
| **veORDI Vault** | Stake ORDI for boosted yield | Very High |

## How Vaults Generate Yield

Vaults earn yield through multiple sources:

- **Trading fees** — A portion of swap fees from associated liquidity pools
- **Rewards** — Protocol incentives and external subsidies
- **Auto-compounding** — A portion of rewards is automatically reinvested

The specific strategy varies by vault—check each vault's "Strategies" tab for details.

## Yield Boosting

Some vaults support yield boosting. By staking vxFROST, you can increase your yield multiplier.
