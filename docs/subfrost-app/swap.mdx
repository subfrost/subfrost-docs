# Swap

:::note
Interface is currently in development and subject to change.
:::

The Swap feature lets you trade between supported assets in a single transaction, settled directly on Bitcoin L1. No bridges, no wrapped tokens to manage manually—just straightforward trading.

**Highlights (some features in development):**
- Single-transaction swaps settled on Bitcoin L1
- Automatic routing for best rates
- Cross-BTCFi support for Alkanes & BRC20s
- Cross-chain support for USDT, SOL, ZEC, and more
- Direct swaps to-and-from Native BTC

## How to Swap

### Step 1: Select Your Tokens

Click the token selector to choose what you want to swap **from** (You Send) and what you want to receive (You Receive).

### Step 2: Enter Amount

Type the amount you want to swap. Use the quick-select buttons for convenience:
- **25%** / **50%** / **75%** / **Max** of your balance

The balance bar shows your usage with color-coded feedback.

### Step 3: Customize Settings & Review

Before confirming, you'll see:
- **Exchange rate** — How much you'll receive per unit
- **Swap route** — The path your swap takes (may show intermediary tokens)
- **Minimum received** — Guaranteed minimum after slippage
- **Deadline (blocks)** — Number of blocks before the quote expires
- **Slippage tolerance** — Maximum acceptable price movement
- **Miner fee rate** — Network fee for the transaction

## Swap Routes

The AMM automatically routes your swap for the best rate:

| Route Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Direct** | Token A ↔ Token B (both in same pool) |
| **Multi-hop** | Token A → Bridge Token → Token B |
| **Wrap/Unwrap** | BTC ↔ frBTC (1:1 conversion) |

### Direct BTC Swaps

When swapping **BTC to another token**, the app first wraps your BTC to frBTC, then swaps to your target token. This happens atomically without the user having to manually wrap their BTC. The wrapping process is abstracted away completely.

When swapping **to BTC**, the reverse happens—your token swaps to frBTC, then unwraps to native BTC automatically. There is a 3-block confirmation period (safety mechanism) before the SUBFROST protocol sends the unwrapped BTC.

## Cross-Chain Swaps

For cross-chain tokens (USDT, USDC, ETH, SOL, ZEC), the interface guides you through a simple bridge process:

1. **User Sends** — Waiting for your deposit
2. **Confirmation** — Confirming on source chain
3. **Swap execution** — Converting & swapping
4. **SUBFROST Sends** — User receives funds
5. **Complete** — Funds confirmed

This is all done automatically once the user performs step 1.

## Liquidity Pools

Switch to the **Liquidity** tab to provide or remove liquidity:

### Providing Liquidity

1. Select the **Add** tab
2. Choose the token pair you want to provide
3. Enter amounts for both tokens
4. Click "Add Liquidity" and sign the transaction

Liquidity providers earn fees from trades in their pool.

Note: For BTC pools, user BTC is atomically wrapped to frBTC.

### Removing Liquidity

Switch to the **Remove** tab to withdraw your liquidity position and reclaim your tokens.

## Tips

- **Check the rate** before confirming—compare against external sources for large trades
- **Start small** if you're new to the platform, to understand the flow
- **Watch price impact** on larger trades; splitting into multiple swaps may get better rates
