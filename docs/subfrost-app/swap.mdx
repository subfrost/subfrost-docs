## How to Swap

### Step 1: Select Your Tokens

Click the token selector to choose what you want to swap **from** (You Send) and what you want to receive (You Receive).

### Step 2: Enter Amount

Type the amount you want to swap. Use the quick-select buttons for convenience:
- **25%** / **50%** / **75%** / **Max** of your balance

The balance bar shows your usage with color-coded feedback.

### Step 3: Review the Quote

Before confirming, you'll see:
- **Exchange rate** — How much you'll receive per unit
- **Swap route** — The path your swap takes (may show intermediary tokens)
- **Minimum received** — Guaranteed minimum after slippage
- **Deadline (blocks)** — Number of blocks before the quote expires
- **Slippage tolerance** — Maximum acceptable price movement
- **Miner fee rate** — Network fee for the transaction

## Swap Routes

The AMM automatically routes your swap for the best rate:

| Route Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Direct** | Token A ↔ Token B (both in same pool) |
| **Multi-hop** | Token A → Bridge Token → Token B |
| **Wrap/Unwrap** | BTC ↔ frBTC (1:1 conversion) |

### BTC Swaps

When swapping **BTC to another token**, the app first wraps your BTC to frBTC, then swaps to your target token. This happens in a guided flow.

When swapping **to BTC**, the reverse happens—your token swaps to frBTC, then unwraps to native BTC.

## Cross-Chain Swaps

For cross-chain tokens (USDT, USDC, ETH, SOL, ZEC), the interface guides you through a bridge process:

1. **Deposit detection** — Waiting for your deposit
2. **Confirmation** — Confirming on source chain
3. **Swap execution** — Converting on SUBFROST
4. **Sending** — Bridging to destination
5. **Complete** — Funds delivered

## Fee Rate Options

Select your Bitcoin miner fee rate:

| Preset | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Slow** | Lower fee, longer confirmation |
| **Medium** | Balanced fee and speed |
| **Fast** | Higher fee, faster confirmation |
| **Custom** | Specify exact sats/vB |

## Liquidity Pools

Switch to the **Liquidity** tab to provide or remove liquidity:

### Providing Liquidity

1. Select the **Add** tab
2. Choose the token pair you want to provide
3. Enter amounts for both tokens
4. Click "Add Liquidity" and sign the transaction

Liquidity providers earn fees from trades in their pool.

### Removing Liquidity

Switch to the **Remove** tab to withdraw your liquidity position and reclaim your tokens.

## Tips

- **Check the rate** before confirming—compare against external sources for large trades
- **Start small** if you're new to the platform to understand the flow
- **Watch price impact** on larger trades; splitting into multiple swaps may get better rates
- **Use wrap/unwrap** for BTC ↔ frBTC conversions (1:1, no slippage)
