## Dual Address Support

SUBFROST generates two address types for full compatibility:

|--------------|--------|----------|
| **Taproot** | `bc1p...` | Modern, efficient transactions |
| **Native SegWit** | `bc1q...` | Broad compatibility |

Both addresses are displayed in the wallet header with copy buttons. Some apps and exchanges prefer one format over the other—having both ensures you can always receive funds.

## Wallet Tabs

### Balances

View your complete asset holdings. The Balances tab shows:

- **Bitcoin Balance** — Total BTC with USD value
- **Spendable BTC** — Available for transactions
- **Unspendable (with Assets)** — BTC locked with inscriptions or tokens
- **Address breakdown** — Native SegWit / Taproot / Pending Transactions
- **Protorune Assets** — Alkanes and similar protocol tokens
- **Inscription Assets** — BRC20 and other inscription-based tokens

### UTXO Management

Fine-grained control over your Bitcoin outputs:

</div>

**What are UTXOs?** Bitcoin works differently than traditional banking—your balance is made up of individual "coins" called UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs). Managing them lets you control exactly which coins you spend.

**Filter by:**
- Address type (Native SegWit / Taproot)
- Asset type (Runes / Tokens / Inscriptions)

**Actions:**

| Action | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Freeze** | Protect a UTXO from being spent accidentally |
| **Unfreeze** | Make it spendable again |
| **Split** | Separate inscriptions from the BTC they're attached to |

:::tip Protect Your Valuables
Freeze UTXOs containing rare inscriptions or collectibles so you don't accidentally spend them as transaction fees.
:::

### Transaction History

<div className="screenshot-placeholder">

:::warning Fee Safety
The app warns you if your fee seems unusually high—always double-check before confirming large transactions.
:::

**Advanced: Manual UTXO Selection**

For power users, you can disable auto-select and manually choose which UTXOs to spend. Useful for privacy, consolidation, or avoiding specific coins.
