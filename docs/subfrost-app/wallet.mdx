## Supported Wallets

Already have a Bitcoin wallet? Connect it directly:

![Wallet Connection Modal](/img/app/WalletConnectionModal.png)

### Connecting

1. Click **"Connect Wallet"** in the header
2. Select your wallet provider
3. Approve the connection in your wallet extension
4. Your addresses appear in the header

## Dual Address Support

SUBFROST generates two address types for full compatibility:

| Address Type | Format | Use Case |
|--------------|--------|----------|
| **Taproot** | `bc1p...` | Alkanes, BRC20s, Runes, Ordinals |
| **Native SegWit** | `bc1q...` | Send and receive BTC |

Both addresses are displayed in the wallet header with copy buttons. Some apps and exchanges prefer one format over the other—having both ensures you can always receive funds.

## Wallet Tabs

### Balances

View your complete asset holdings. The Balances tab shows:

- **Bitcoin Balance** — Total BTC with USD value
- **Spendable BTC** — Available for transactions
- **Unspendable (with Assets)** — BTC locked with inscriptions or tokens
- **Address breakdown** — Native SegWit / Taproot / Pending Transactions
- **Protorune Assets** — Alkanes and similar protocol tokens
- **Inscription Assets** — BRC20 and other inscription-based tokens

### UTXO Management

Fine-grained control over your Bitcoin outputs:

  ? Screenshot: UTXO management tab
</div>

**What are UTXOs?** Bitcoin works differently than traditional banking—your balance is made up of individual "coins" called UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs). Managing them lets you control exactly which coins you spend.

**Filter by:**
- Address type (Native SegWit / Taproot)
- Asset type (Runes / Tokens / Inscriptions)

**Actions:**

| Action | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Freeze** | Protect a UTXO from being spent accidentally |
| **Unfreeze** | Make it spendable again |
| **Split** | Separate inscriptions from the BTC they're attached to |

:::tip Protect Your Valuables
If you are exclusively using a Taproot address, freeze UTXOs containing rare inscriptions or collectibles so you don't accidentally spend them as transaction fees.
:::

### Transaction History

<div className="screenshot-placeholder">

- **Status** — Confirmed (green) or pending (yellow)
- **Transaction ID** — Click to view on block explorer

- **HD Wallet Derivation** — View your active addresses and configure derivation
- **Security & Backup** — Export backups, manage your seed phrase

## Sending Bitcoin

![Send Modal](/img/app/SendModal.png)

1. **Enter recipient address** — Supports all Bitcoin address formats
2. **Enter amount** — In BTC
3. **Choose fee rate** — Slow / Medium / Fast / Custom
4. **Review & Send** — Check everything before confirming
5. **Sign & broadcast** — Your wallet signs the transaction

:::warning Fee Safety
The app warns you if your fee seems unusually high—always double-check before confirming large transactions.
:::

**Advanced: Manual UTXO Selection**

SUBFROST automatically selects UTXOs in your Native SegWit address.

For power users, you can disable auto-select and manually choose which UTXOs to spend (SegWit or Taproot). This is useful for privacy, consolidation, or avoiding specific coins.
