# `subfrost-runtime`: The SUBFROST Runtime

`subfrost-runtime` is the core of the SUBFROST node. It is a WASM program that contains the consensus logic for the SUBFROST protocol. It is responsible for:

*   **Processing blocks:** The `subfrost-runtime` processes blocks from the Bitcoin blockchain and updates the state of the SUBFROST protocol accordingly.
*   **Validating transactions:** The `subfrost-runtime` validates transactions that are submitted to the SUBFROST network.
*   **Executing smart contracts:** The `subfrost-runtime` executes smart contracts that are written in the SUBFROST smart contract language.

## The `subfrost-runtime` API

The `subfrost-runtime` exposes a simple API that allows the SUBFROST node to interact with it. The API consists of two functions:

*   `subfrost_sync`: This function is called by the SUBFROST node to sync the `subfrost-runtime` with the latest state of the Bitcoin blockchain.
*   `subfrost_get_bundle`: This function is called by the SUBFROST node to get a bundle of transactions that can be submitted to the Bitcoin blockchain.

## The `subfrost-runtime` in SUBFROST

The `subfrost-runtime` is a key component of the SUBFROST protocol. It is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the SUBFROST network and for ensuring that all transactions are processed correctly.

### Building the `subfrost-runtime`

You can build the `subfrost-runtime` using the following command:

```bash
cargo build --release -p subfrost-runtime
```

This will create a WASM file at `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/subfrost_runtime.wasm`. This file can then be used to run a SUBFROST node.
