# SUBFROST Overview
Bitcoin DeFi represents one of the most promising frontiers in finance. Yet, native BTC is not directly compatible with advanced applications on Bitcoin L1 ecosystems, such as AMMs, lending protocols, or privacy solutions such as zk mixers.

SUBFROST unlocks this potential by issuing synthetic assets that enable native BTC to seamlessly power the next generation of DeFi.


## What is SUBFROST?
SUBFROST is a decentralized custodian that enables a trustless DeFi ecosystem on Bitcoin L1. 

It operates as a [**Layer-0**](/introduction/technical-overview), designed to issue BTC synthetic assets directly onto Bitcoin via execution layers like **Alkanes, Arch, BRC 2.0**, etc. Without it, there will be a continued reliance on trust-dependent, cross-chain options.

The future is bright for Bitcoin DeFi and SUBFROST is a fundamental component of this future.
