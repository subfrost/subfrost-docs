# SUBFROST Overview
Bitcoin DeFi represents one of the most promising frontiers in finance. Yet, native BTC is not directly compatible with advanced applications on Bitcoin L1 ecosystems, including AMMs, lending protocols, or privacy solutions such as zk mixers.

SUBFROST unlocks this potential by issuing synthetic assets that enable native BTC to seamlessly power the next generation of DeFi.


## What is SUBFROST?
SUBFROST is a decentralized custodian that enables a trustless DeFi ecosystem on Bitcoin L1. 

It operates as a [**Layer-0**](/introduction/technical-overview), issuing synthetic assets directly on Bitcoin through execution layers such as **Alkanes, Arch, BRC 2.0,** and **MIDL**.

Without it, "Bitcoin DeFi" will continue to rely on trust-dependent cross-chain alternatives, which we wouldn't consider "Bitcoin DeFi" at all.
