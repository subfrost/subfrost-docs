# SUBFROST Overview
Bitcoin DeFi represents one of the most promising frontiers in finance. Yet, native BTC is not directly compatible with advanced applications on Bitcoin L1 ecosystems, such as AMMs, lending protocols, or privacy solutions like zk mixers.

SUBFROST unlocks this potential by enabling native BTC to seamlessly power the next generation of DeFi.

This is done through the issuance of two DeFi-compatible BTC synthetics, crucial to a competitive ecosystem on Bitcoin:
1. **frBTC**: the synthetic asset pegged 1:1 to BTC on Bitcoin L1, enabling users to leverage their BTC across any application without ever leaving the Bitcoin blockchain. Learn more [**here.**](../tokens/frBTC-overview)
2. **dxBTC**: the yield-bearing variant of BTC, enabling users to maintain full exposure to BTC while earning a yield in the simplest and most secure way possible. Learn more [**here.**](../tokens/dxBTC-overview)


## What is SUBFROST?
SUBFROST is a decentralized custodian that enables a trustless DeFi ecosystem on Bitcoin L1. 

It operates as a [**Layer-0**](/introduction/technical-overview), designed to issue BTC synthetic assets directly onto Bitcoin via execution layers like **Alkanes, Arch, BRC 2.0**, etc. Without it, there will be a continued reliance on trust-dependent, cross-chain options.

The future is bright for Bitcoin DeFi and SUBFROST is a fundamental component of this future.
