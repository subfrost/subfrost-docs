# SUBFROST Overview
Bitcoin DeFi is one of the most promising spaces in finance. However, native BTC is **not** compatible with complex applications built on Bitcoin L1 ecosystems, like AMMs, borrow/lends and zk mixers.

SUBFROST exists to issue two DeFi-compatible BTC synthetics, crucial to a competitive DeFi ecosystem on Bitcoin:
1. **frBTC**: the synthetic asset pegged 1:1 to BTC on Bitcoin L1, enabling users to leverage their BTC across any application without ever leaving the Bitcoin blockchain. Learn more **<a href={useBaseUrl('/tokens/frBTC-overview')}>here.</a>**
2. **dxBTC**: the yield-bearing variant of BTC, enabling users to maintain full exposure to BTC while earning a yield in the simplest and most secure way possible. Learn more **<a href={useBaseUrl('/tokens/dxBTC-overview')}>here.</a>**

## What is SUBFROST?
SUBFROST is a decentralized custodian that enables a trustless DeFi ecosystem on Bitcoin L1. 

It operates as a <a href={useBaseUrl('/introduction/technical-overview')}>**Layer-0**</a>, designed to issue BTC synthetic assets directly onto Bitcoin via execution layers like Alkanes, Arch, BRC 2.0, etc. Without it, there will be a lack of adoption in Bitcoin DeFi and a continued reliance on trust-dependent, cross-chain options like wrapped BTC on Ethereum.

The future is bright for Bitcoin DeFi, and SUBFROST will be a fundamental component of this future.
