# Technical Overview
SUBFROST operates as a Layer-0, building fraud proofs as ZK circuits to ensure the integrity of its operations. 
At its core, SUBFROST uses the Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold (FROST) and Robust Asynchronous Schnorr Threshold (ROAST) signature schemes, allowing signing groups of up to 255 participants to collectively sign transactions.

This decentralized approach to custody is managed by a peer-to-peer network built on QUIC and libp2p, ensuring robust and secure communication.

In the following pages, we will cover the core components of SUBFROST, including but not limited to:

- [**FROST & ROAST Cryptography**](/key-components/frost-and-roast): The threshold signature schemes that power decentralized custody.
- [**Alkanes Protocol**](/key-components/alkanes): The metaprotocol that pegs SUBFROST to the Bitcoin blockchain.
- [**Peer-to-Peer Networking**](/subfrost-networking/introduction-to-subp2p): The communication layer built on QUIC and libp2p.
