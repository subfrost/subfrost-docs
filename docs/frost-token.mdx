# FROST Token Overview
## SUBFROST Protocol Token

`FROST` is an integral componant of the [SUBFROST Proof-of-Stake](./developer-guide/proof-of-stake.mdx), with deflationary mechanics. All protocol fees are used to buy & burn `FROST`, driving value to holders by increasing demand and decreasing supply.

Example to illustrate this process:
1. A user wraps 1 BTC to `frBTC` and they pay a small fee of 0.10% to do this.
2. SUBFROST collects this 0.001 BTC fee and automatically buys `FROST` tokens from the open market.
3. SUBFROST then burns these `FROST` tokens.

**Tokenomics:** Structured to maximize alignment between incentives and long-term outcomes of SUBFROST and Bitcoin DeFi at large, currently, this 1B `FROST` (expected) is allocated in the following ways:
- 15% to early contributors, where equity converts to FROST with a vesting period.
- 85% to team, builder, and community incentive programs.
