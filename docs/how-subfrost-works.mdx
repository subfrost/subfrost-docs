title: How it (Technically) Works

import { Card, CardGrid } from '@site/src/components/Card';

SUBFROST operates as a Layer-0, building fraud proofs as ZK circuits to ensure the integrity of its operations. 
At its core, SUBFROST uses the **FROST** (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold) signature scheme, allowing signing groups of up to 255 participants to collectively sign transactions. 
This decentralized approach to custody is managed by a peer-to-peer network built on QUIC and libp2p, ensuring robust and secure communication. Further, SUBFROST is the first network to enforce honest behavior via slashing of the staker's BTC itself.
