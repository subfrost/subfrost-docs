It is the engine that powers synthetic assets like frBTC and enables complex logic to be executed in a way that is verifiable by the underlying SUBFROST consensus.","sidebar":"docs"},"developer-guide/frost-protocol":{"id":"developer-guide/frost-protocol","title":"FROST Protocol","description":"FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold) is the cryptographic cornerstone of the SUBFROST sidechain. It is a threshold signature scheme that allows a large, dynamic set of validators to collectively create a single Schnorr signature without any single validator ever possessing the full private key.","sidebar":"docs"},"developer-guide/introduction":{"id":"developer-guide/introduction","title":"Developer Introduction","description":"This guide provides a deep dive into the technical architecture of the SUBFROST ecosystem. It is intended for developers who want to build on, or contribute to, the SUBFROST platform.","sidebar":"docs"},"developer-guide/proof-of-stake":{"id":"developer-guide/proof-of-stake","title":"Proof-of-Stake","description":"SUBFROST is secured by a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism where network participants, known as validators, stake the native FROST token to gain the right to participate in consensus. This economic stake incentivizes validators to act honestly and maintain the integrity of the network.","sidebar":"docs"},"developer-guide/subrail":{"id":"developer-guide/subrail","title":"Subrail Runtime","description":"Subrail is the high-performance WebAssembly (WASM) runtime at the heart of the SUBFROST node. It is specifically designed to execute the consensus-critical logic of Alkanes and other state transition functions within the SUBFROST ecosystem.","sidebar":"docs"},"index":{"id":"index","title":"Introduction to SUBFROST","description":"SUBFROST is a novel trust-minimized Bitcoin sidechain that leverages the FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold) signature scheme to secure its two-way peg. It introduces a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, where validators stake the native FROST token to secure the network and earn rewards.","sidebar":"docs"},"references/deezel-cli":{"id":"references/deezel-cli","title":"deezel CLI","description":"The deezel command-line interface is the primary tool for end-users to interact with the SUBFROST network.

This is achieved through a trust-minimized process that locks BTC on the Bitcoin mainnet and mints a corresponding amount of frBTC on the SUBFROST sidechain.","sidebar":"docs"}}}}')}}]);
