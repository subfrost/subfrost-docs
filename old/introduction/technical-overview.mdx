# Technical Overview

SUBFROST operates as a Layer-0, building fraud proofs as ZK circuits to ensure the integrity of its operations. 
At its core, SUBFROST uses the FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold) and ROAST (Robust Asynchronous Schnorr Threshold) signature schemes, allowing signing groups of up to 255 participants to collectively sign transactions.

This decentralized approach to custody is managed by a peer-to-peer network built on QUIC and libp2p, ensuring robust and secure communication.

In the following pages, we will cover the core components of SUBFROST, including but not limited to:

- [**FROST & ROAST Cryptography**](/key-components/frost-and-roast): The threshold signature schemes that power decentralized custody.
- [**Alkanes Metaprotocol**](/key-components/alkanes): The metaprotocol that pegs SUBFROST to the Bitcoin blockchain.
- [**Subrail**](/developer-guide/subrail): The WASM runtime for executing consensus-critical logic.
- [**Peer-to-Peer Networking**](/subfrost-networking/introduction-to-subp2p): The communication layer built on QUIC and libp2p.
